# Web Blocker -- Web Extension
1. Currently trying to learn JavaScript so that i can translate the python source code 
2. I thought about using WebAssebmbly to maintain the logic in Python using Pyodide, but JavaScript seems like a perfect option
3. Will implement the script as a backend, perhaps as Django or Flask
